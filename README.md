# N-Body-Gravity-Simulation
Hello!! This is a simple 2D simulation where you can spawn particles of both positive and 
negative energies and they'll interact with each other due to their gravitational forces. The calculation 
follows Newtonian mechanics with the value of the universal gravitational constant, G, set to 0.01. 
If two particles come too close, they won't collide but instead will pass through each other. Also keep in 
mind that spawning too many particles may cause some serious CPU load.

You need to have installed Python 3.9 or later along with Numpy and Pygame libraries to run the file.

This program is open for modifications but you should give proper credit if you're gonna upload or share it.

Cheers!
